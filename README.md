# Go Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice Go

## Projects
1. **Simple CLI Task Manager**
   - **Overview:** Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) task manager where users can add, remove, and list tasks.
   - **Skills:** Basic understanding of Go syntax, command-line arguments handling, basic file I/O for storing tasks.

2. **RESTful API with CRUD Operations**
   - **Overview:** Develop a RESTful API using Go's standard `net/http` package for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a resource like todo tasks.
   - **Skills:** HTTP handling in Go, routing, request handling, JSON encoding/decoding.

3. **User Authentication System**
   - **Overview:** Implement a user authentication system with features like signup, login, logout, and password hashing.
   - **Skills:** Understanding of authentication mechanisms, use of Go packages for password hashing, working with sessions/cookies.

4. **Simple Web Scraper**
   - **Overview:** Build a web scraper that extracts data from a website and saves it to a file or database.
   - **Skills:** HTTP requests in Go, HTML parsing, understanding of basic web scraping etiquette and legalities.

5. **Basic CRUD Web Application**
   - **Overview:** Create a web application with a frontend interface for CRUD operations on a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).
   - **Skills:** Integrating Go with a web framework (e.g., Gin, Echo), templating, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.

6. **Real-time Chat Application**
   - **Overview:** Develop a simple real-time chat application using WebSockets.
   - **Skills:** Working with WebSockets in Go, handling concurrent connections, basic understanding of real-time communication protocols.

7. **RESTful API Authentication with JWT**
   - **Overview:** Enhance the previous RESTful API project by adding JWT-based authentication.
   - **Skills:** Understanding JWT (JSON Web Tokens), middleware implementation for authentication, securing API endpoints.

8. **Microservices Architecture**
   - **Overview:** Refactor your RESTful API project into a microservices architecture with separate services for different functionalities.
   - **Skills:** Understanding microservices architecture, inter-service communication (e.g., gRPC or REST), service discovery, containerization (e.g., Docker).

9. **Asynchronous Task Queue**
   - **Overview:** Implement an asynchronous task queue using a library like `celery` or `RabbitMQ` for background processing.
   - **Skills:** Understanding of concurrency in Go (goroutines, channels), working with external task queue libraries.

10. **Full-stack Web Application**
    - **Overview:** Build a full-stack web application with a Go backend, a frontend framework like React or Vue, and a database.
    - **Skills:** Integrating Go with a frontend framework, RESTful API design, state management, deployment considerations.
